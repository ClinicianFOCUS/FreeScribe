"""Whisper Hallucination Cleaner.

This module provides functionality to clean common hallucinations from Whisper transcriptions.
It uses spaCy's vector similarity to detect and remove common phrases that Whisper tends to
hallucinate at the end of transcriptions.

Example:
    >>> from services.whisper_hallucination_cleaner import hallucination_cleaner
    >>> text = "This is a real transcription. Thanks for watching!"
    >>> cleaned = hallucination_cleaner.clean_text(text)
    >>> print(cleaned)
    'This is a real transcription.'
